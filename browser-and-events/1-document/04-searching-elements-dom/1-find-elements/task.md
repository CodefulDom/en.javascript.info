## Search for elements

Here's the document with the table and form.

How to find?...

1. The table with `id="age-table"`.
2. All `label` elements inside that table \(there should be 3 of them\).
3. The first `td` in that table \(with the word "Age"\).
4. The `form` with `name="search"`.
5. The first `input` in that form.
6. The last `input` in that form.

Open the page [table.html](https://github.com/CodefulDom/en.javascript.info/tree/a035351fcfceb747760a1d9bd2c652f624999a4a/2-ui/1-document/04-searching-elements-dom/1-find-elements/table.html) in a separate window and make use of browser tools for that.
