## The variable for our planet

That's simple:

```javascript
let ourPlanetName = "Earth";
```

Note, we could use a shorter name `planet`, but it might be not obvious what planet it refers to. It's nice to be more verbose. At least until the variable isNotTooLong.

## The name of the current visitor

```javascript
let currentUserName = "John";
```

Again, we could shorten that to `userName` if we know for sure that the user is current.

Modern editors and autocomplete make long variable names easy to write. Don't save on them. A name with 3 words in it is fine.

And if your editor does not have proper autocompletion, get [a new one](https://github.com/CodefulDom/en.javascript.info/tree/a035351fcfceb747760a1d9bd2c652f624999a4a/code-editors/README.md).
