# The Modern JavaScript Tutorial

The JavaScript portion of the course comes from: [https://javascript.info](https://javascript.info). As we add parts on I will make note of where the resources came from.

## Structure

Every chapter, article or a task has its folder.

The type of the material is defined by the file inside the folder:

* `index.md` stands for a chapter
* `article.md` stands for an article
* `task.md` stands for a task \(solution must be provided in `solution.md` file aswell\)

Each of these files starts from the `# Main header`.

It's very easy to add something new.
