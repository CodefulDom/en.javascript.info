# The Modern JavaScript Tutorial

### Structure

Every chapter, article or a task has its folder.

The type of the material is defined by the file inside the folder:

* `index.md` stands for a chapter
* `article.md` stands for an article
* `task.md` stands for a task \(solution must be provided in `solution.md` file as well\)

Each of these files starts from the `# Main header`.

It's very easy to add something new.
